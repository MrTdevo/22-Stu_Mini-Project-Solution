## Mini Project 05/12/2024
 ### I built this website to fulfill the class requirement. 
 The below is what I have learnt so far:
 - Margin will help you with positioning
 - Pay attention to section created as you might need to drill into more child of a set class 
 - The website will take input from customer that want to contact us.
   1. Name
   2. Email.
   
BLUF: This is a work in progress for me.
